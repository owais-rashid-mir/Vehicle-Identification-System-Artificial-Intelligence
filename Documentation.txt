Documentation - Info about files and working of project.

1. **main.py**:
   - Loads YOLOv8 models for vehicle detection and license plate detection.
   - Reads a video file (sample2.mp4) frame by frame.
   - Detects vehicles using YOLOv8 and tracks them using the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm.
   - Detects license plates on the detected vehicles using the license plate detection model.
   - Reads the license plate numbers using EasyOCR.
   - Saves the results in a CSV file (test.csv).

2. **util.py**:
   - Contains utility functions for writing results to a CSV file, checking license plate format, formatting license plate text, and reading license plates from images.
   
3. **visualize.py**:
   - Visualizes the results by drawing bounding boxes around vehicles and license plates.
   - Combines the license plate image with the original frame and adds the license plate number as text.
   - Saves the processed frames as a video (out.mp4).

4. **add_missing_data.py**:
   - Interpolates missing data in the CSV file to ensure that each frame has consistent information for each vehicle.
   - It uses linear interpolation to estimate bounding boxes and other details for frames where data is missing.
   - Writes the updated data to a new CSV file (test_interpolated.csv).

Overall, this project takes a video as input, performs vehicle detection, license plate recognition, tracking, and visualization, and then saves the results in a CSV file and an output video. The interpolation script helps fill in missing data to create a more complete dataset.
